# This gql is meant to give an overview of the schema.

# It is loosely following the [Shopify Graphql Design Tutorial](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-design-tutorial/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#step-one-a-birds-eye-view).

# I think the benefit of this overview is to realise early on how the data
# relationships, inheritence, etc., is to be modeled using GraphQL before a lot
# of time is spent describing each of the individual fields.
#
# This overview includes:
# - Object types
# - Some object fields
# - Object fields that model relationships

# This overview DOES NOT include: 
# - Granular object fields
# - Mutations
